            <h2>Information</h2>
            <p>he Temple of Artemis (artemisia) was located near the ancient city of Ephesus, about 75 kilometres (47 mi) south from the modern port city of İzmir, in Turkey. Today the site lies on the edge of the modern town of Selçuk. In the 7th century BCE, a flood destroyed the temple, depositing over half a meter of sand and flotsam over the original clay floor.</p>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 85px;">The Temple of Artemis or Artemision (Greek: Ἀρτεμίσιον; Turkish: Artemis Tapınağı), also known as the Temple of Diana, was a Greek temple dedicated to a localised form of the goddess Artemis (equated with the Roman goddess Diana). It was located in Ephesus, near modern day Selçuk in Turkey). The original temple was among the Seven Wonders of the World and was burnt down in 356 by Herostratos on the eve of the birth of Alexander the Great. While it had been destroyed and rebuilt many times in ancient history, the last incarnation of the temple was destroyed in 401 CE. Only foundations and fragments of the last temple remain in the present day.</p>
